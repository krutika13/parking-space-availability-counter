# Parking Space and Car Counting (YOLOv8-based)

This repository contains solutions to real-time parking space detection and car counting using YOLOv8. It covers the following tasks:

---

## ðŸš© Problem Statements & Objectives

### Task 1: YOLOv8 Training and Inference on Images
- **Objective:** Train a YOLOv8s model to detect parking slots as `empty` or `occupied`.
- **Output:** Bounding boxes with confidence scores and class labels.

### Task 2: Model Export & GPU Inference (ONNX)
- **Objective:** Export the trained model to ONNX format and evaluate performance using GPU with ONNXRuntime.
- **Output:** Frame-wise inference with FPS benchmarking.

### Task 3: Parking Space & Car Counting (Steady Camera)
- **Objective:** Use a steady surveillance video feed to detect available parking spaces in real time.
- **Method:** Manually define empty slots once â†’ Apply YOLOv8s per frame â†’ Check car presence inside predefined slots.
- **Output:** Dynamic counter showing available vs. occupied spaces (e.g., 12 â†’ 11).

## ðŸ“¦ Data Sources & Preprocessing

- **Source:** Custom parking lot dataset (annotated with `empty` and `occupied`).
- **Split:**
  - Train: 70%
  - Validation: 20%
  - Test: 10%
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Resize all images to 640x640
  - Normalization [0, 1] pixel values
  - Format: YOLO `.txt` annotations with bounding boxes

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architectures & Training Pipeline

- **Backbone:** [YOLOv8s](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- **Input Size:** 640x640
- **Epochs:** 50  
- **Batch Size:** 8  
- **Loss Function:** YOLOv8's native object detection loss (classification + box regression)
- **Optimizer:** SGD with momentum  
- **Augmentation:** HSV shift, flip, mosaic, mixup (Ultralytics defaults)

### Training Command
```bash
from ultralytics import YOLO

model = YOLO('yolov8s.yaml')  # small YOLO model
model.train(
    data="data.yaml",
    epochs=50,
    imgsz=640,
    batch=8,
    project='results',
    name='car_detection',
    exist_ok=True
)


## Model Performance

Evaluation metrics of the trained YOLOv8s model on the validation set:

| Class     | recision | Recall | mAP50 | mAP50-95 |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| all       |   0.927  | 0.922  | 0.962 | 0.837    |
| empty     |   0.888  | 0.898  | 0.944 | 0.779    |
| occupied  |   0.966  | 0.946  | 0.980 | 0.895    |
